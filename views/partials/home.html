    <h1>Hello {{home.name}}</h1>

    <h3>This is a Busuu front end test app
        <br>We would like you to implement a very simple vocabulary game.</h3>

    <em class="lead">The technology is AngularJS, Bootstrap and LessCSS on front end, with NodeJS communication endpoint
        on
        backend.</em>
    <br>

    <p class="text-left">
        You will find 11 words with keyphrases and spanish translation hardcoded in words AngularJS value in
        public/js/services.js.

        On every round one random word is chosen - question asked to the player. We show player english word with
        english keyphrase.
        We also provide 3 answers - shown to user in Spanish - chosen randomly from 11 words provided (one of them is
        translation of previously randomly chosen word).
        The game consists of 3 rounds. If the user chooses the wrong answer the game is finished.
        When the game is finished the user can enter his name. If he does, the score is sent to the server, and will
        appear on "High score" subpage of the app. This subpage will download highscore list, using $http AngularJS
        service.
        <br><br>
        <em>Tip: No need to use any database persistence on server-side - keeping data in NodeJS memory is sufficient
            for this test.</em>
